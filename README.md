### Translations

Translators are invited to help translate the App Fair strings into
their local language.
We use the "Weblate" translation interface to enable
translation contirbutions without needing to use
source control management directly.

Start contributing by going to:
[hosted.weblate.org/projects/appfair/app-fair](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/appfair/app-fair/#translations).

### Notes

App Fair.app is unique among its peer [appfair.net](https://appfair.net) apps
in that it is **not** sandboxed.
This is necessary in order to enable it to install other apps.
